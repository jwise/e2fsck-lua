Enjoyed:

  intriguing challenge; removed much of the magic from ext2 inodes and
    lost+found reconnection.

Anti-enjoyed / suggestion:

  It seemed like I wrote a lot of driver code for a very small "user"
  application; the Fsck driver itself was 330 lines, whereas the rest of the
  support code ended up being another 1000 lines...  it seemed like a lot of
  support code for little actual application code.  It would be nice to
  write, say, a FUSE driver for it, or more substantial of a fsck (checking
  and repairing more different types of inconsistencies that can arise in
  ext2/ext3.)

Remember to also read the README.
